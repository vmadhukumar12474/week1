Welcome! This repo captures my journey through the **SoC Tapeout Program VSD**‚Äîa hands-on experience designing a RISC-V System-on-Chip from RTL coding to GDSII tapeout using open-source tools. As part of India‚Äôs biggest collaborative venture, 3500+ participants are enabled to build silicon and push the country‚Äôs semiconductor ecosystem forward.
## VSD Program Summary


## üìÖ Week 1 ‚Äî Tool Usage
- **Icarus Verilog (iverilog):**  
  Used to compile and simulate Verilog HDL designs and testbenches.
- **GTKWave:**  
  Utilized to visualize simulation waveforms for functional verification.
- **Yosys:**  
  Synthesizer tool to convert RTL Verilog into gate-level netlists for further hardware implementation.
- **GVim:**  
  Graphical text editor used to edit RTL code and testbenches with a more user-friendly interface.

## Designs Completed
- **4-bit Multiplier:**  
  Developed and verified a digital multiplier module.
- **N-bit Adder:**  
  Created an adder module with corresponding testbench for validation.
- **Multiplexer (mux):**  
  Designed and tested multiplexers of various sizes.

## üôè Thanks to These Contributors

Much appreciation to [**Kunal Ghosh**](https://github.com/kunalg123) and the [VLSI System Design (VSD)](https://vsdiat.vlsisystemdesign.com/) team for making this possible. Also grateful to RISC-V International, the India Semiconductor Mission, VLSI Society of India, and [Efabless](https://github.com/efabless) for their indispensable support.

## Summary
This week‚Äôs focus was on mastering the toolchain needed for RTL design and verification. Hands-on experience with Icarus Verilog, GTKWave, Yosys, and GVim strengthened my understanding of digital design workflows including coding, simulation, synthesis, and debugging. The designs implemented form a strong foundation for the upcoming SoC tapeout stages in the VSD program.
